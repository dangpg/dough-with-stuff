## Usage

- Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Manually set environment variables or create `.env` file in root folder

```bash
VITE_API_URL=<INSERT-URL-HERE>    // base API url
VITE_USE_DUMMY_API=               // set to non-empty string in case you want to mock API
```

- Run development server on port `1337`

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Create production build

```bash
pnpm build
```

- Serve production build/static files

```bash
pnpm serve
```

## Containerize application

1. Build container

```bash
docker build -t dangpg/dough-with-stuff
```

2. Run container in interactive mode

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 1337:1337 dangpg/dough-with-stuff
```

3. Production build is accessible at `http://localhost:1337`

## Vitest + React Testing Library tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Cypress E2E tests

1. Make sure application is running on localhost:1337

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Create `cypress.env.json` in root folder

```json
{
  "USERNAME": "<insert-username-here>",
  "PASSWORD": "<insert-password-here>"
}
```

3. Either run E2e in UI or headless mode

```bash
pnpm e2e

OR

pnpm e2e:headless
```
